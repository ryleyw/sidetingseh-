Hello ryleyw,

Welcome to your first personal repo on Github.

Starting a project can seem daunting and feel overwhelming...
That's because it is. 

The first steps are always the hardest.
Just thinking about how to approach the problem can make people nervous.

Try to keep your project components as separate as possible.
You'll want to redo something, maybe in a different language, using a different framework, who knows.

And when you do, just make sure you haven't come too far.
